      " Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\n",

      "Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\n",

      "In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n",

      "I am a student applying to the Booth MBA joint programs and considering the alternatives of MBA/MPCS versus MBA/MS-ADS. What are the main differences in programs and outcomes?\n",
      "\n",
      "The fields of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science intersect with industry domains in different ways. The MPCS program focuses on the center of Computer Science, including Software Engineering, High Performance Computing, Data Analytics, and Application Development. The MS-ADS Program focuses at the intersection of multiple fields, such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics (including Statistical Inference, Linear/Non-Linear Models, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning). The outcomes for MPCS students include Software Engineer (Developer), Senior Software Engineering Management, Software/Hardware Architect, and Senior Cyber Security Engineer. The outcomes for students in MS-ADS include roles as Data Scientist (most common), Senior Data Science Consultant, Business Intelligence (BI) Director, Data Visualization Manager, Data Analytics Engineer, and AI Solution Architect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are there differences between MS-ADS and MPCS in terms of requirements for quantitative and/or programming competencies as an applicant?\n",
      "\n",
      "The expectations are similar in terms of STEM aptitude, including undergraduate exposure to Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science and experience in internships/industry. Specific requirements differ, with the MS-ADS Program requiring programming skills in specific languages used in Data Science (Python and R). Statistics and Linear Algebra as it applies to Machine Learning are required for MS-ADS. There are enough differences that the background required to prepare for the program is specified within each program’s supplemental requirements page in the Booth application.\n",

      "\n",
      "The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Science initiated the development of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) in 2014. The project was motivated by the need for an Earth system model to support DOE’s energy mission and meet the requirement to run on the next-generation Exascale computing systems. To provide actionable information on the climate impacts on energy and water sectors and how climate change may influence sustainable energy futures, we developed a three-pronged strategy focusing on high-resolution modeling to improve simulations of extreme events that impact energy production and use, modeling the coupled human-Earth system to project future outcomes, and large ensemble modeling to quantify uncertainty. In this lecture, I will briefly introduce E3SM, including the recently released E3SM version 3 and the global cloud-resolving model (SCREAM) that achieves a throughput of over one simulated year per day on the Frontier exascale computer. With an emphasis on modeling extreme events and their future changes, we further leverage AI/ML to reduce model biases in simulating the large-scale circulations associated with extreme events, improve model calibration and uncertainty quantification, and address the challenges in modeling hurricane risk and wildfires.\n",

      " program gathered for a weekend of connection and discovery. Held at this iconic landmark and on UChicago’s Hyde Park campus, the Spring 2025 Immersion Weekend brought virtual classmates together in person— sparking conversation and a true sense of community.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Immersion Weekend held at the Chicago Athletic Association was a testament to the strength of the UChicago MS in Applied Data Science community,” said current student Nathan Rickert. “The opportunity to connect with incoming students, share experiences, and engage in meaningful discussions showcased how this program fosters collaboration and mentorship.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, students boarded a shuttle to the University’s Hyde Park campus for a full day of learning and connection. The morning began with opening remarks from Aaron Dinner, Deputy Dean of the Physical Sciences Division, who welcomed students to campus and emphasized the importance of collaboration, innovation, and community within the data science field. His inspiring remarks set the tone for the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the welcome, students participated in a Capstone Roundtable Discussion, an interactive session where alumni and near-graduates rotated among tables to share insights from their Capstone Projects. From solving real-world business problems to navigating stakeholder expectations, the roundtable offered students a valuable look at how coursework translates into tangible impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterward, faculty members from the MS in Applied Data Science program took the stage for a “Meet Your Professors” segment. Each instructor introduced themselves, shared their areas of expertise, and gave students a glimpse into the academic experience that defines the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other highlights from the day included:\n",
      "\n",
      "A Campus Tour and visit to the Data Science Institute: Students explored the historic campus, including taking a trip to the Data Science Institute\n",
      "\n",
      "Bookstore and Headshots: Students visited the UChicago bookstore, and took time to get professional headshots\n",
      "\n",
      "“Immersion Weekend was a great experience!” shared current student Mohammad Khan. “After two quarters of classes on Zoom, it was energizing to connect in person with classmates and the faculty. Being able to build those relationships face-to-face made the program feel even more engaging and meaningful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rounding out a day of connection, Associate Clinical Professor \n",
      "Nick Kadochnikov\n",
      " led students through an interactive data science exercise using our very own City of Chicago data. Pouring over real Chicago data, students came up with their assessments, suggestions, and interpretations to present their teams’ findings to the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shuttle ride back to NBC Tower was filled with chatter about marathons, LinkedIn contact sharing, and optimal heart rates for cognition exchanged by students, staff, and instructors alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immersion Weekend is more than just a campus visit—it’s a chance to step into the UChicago experience, meet the people who shape the program, and forge lasting connections with peers from across the country. Spring 2025 Immersion Weekend students left with new skills and a deeper connection to their UChicago network.\n",

      " Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\n",

Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.\n",

It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\n",

      " Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch.

      "Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.\n",

      "This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\n",

      "DSI Data Science Clinic\n",
      ", helping a nonprofit track deforestation caused by the palm oil industry, and it was addictive,” she said. Launa now serves as a staff software engineer at the DSI, partnering with social impact organizations through The 11\n",

      "\n",
      "Alumni paths ventured beyond traditional engineering roles as well: Andrew Fan (BA ’13), explained how journalism at the Invisible Institute, where he serves as Executive Director, grows out of innovative analyses conducted with direction from community voices. Speaking about the genesis of the Invisible Institute’s 2023 investigation “\n",
      "Missing in Chicago\n",
      ",” which earned a 2024 Pulitzer Prize in local reporting, Fan said, “We didn’t start out with missing persons. We actually found it through data-based inquiry. We created a system where we were looking at huge troughs of police complaints to identify patterns in police handling, teaming with community volunteers to help us understand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kayecee Palisoc (MSCAPP ’24) knew she wanted to apply her skills to structural issues but didn’t know how. As a DSI Community Data Fellow in 2023, Palisoc was able to assist the State of Illinois Commission on Equity and Inclusion’s financial inclusion program. “That was my first exposure to government work,” she said, “and looking back that led me to my current role.” Today, in her work with the City of Chicago’s Department of Technology and Innovation, she serves as a liaison between technical providers and the City.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alums shared advice for students preparing to enter the workforce fulltime, encouraging students to “try to get into the community and work with organizations to discover their needs.” Greer emphasized that “tech is most effective when it’s really rooted in the needs of the community, rather than the flashy new thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She further advised students to “own your skills development,” and reminded them to leverage the community they build on campus: “You might be the most technical person in your organization,” she said, “but you have a network that extends beyond it that you can draw on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Responsible Data Science: What Does It Mean in 2025?\n",
      "\n",
      "Highlighting social impact data and AI case studies, Hazem Mahmoud, Director of Products and Services at PJMF, shared some of the principles the Foundation applies throughout development from ideation to testing, deployment, and maintenance, which included ensuring tools remain people & community-focused, and keeping humans in the loop during production. He presented examples of tools that PJMF has developed with this approach to address needs ranging from access to clean water in refugee camps to financial due diligence tools for grant makers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mahmoud emphasized the vital role of data scientists and engineers in 2025: “If you think about tech today, it impacts how we spend our time together, the relationships we have, the values we decide we want to keep as a society, and that’s a huge responsibility.” He encouraged students to meet this challenge proactively by asking questions, educating themselves through coursework in ethics, and advocating in their work to “take the time to contribute to open-source tools that protect users and communities.”\n",

      "Illustrating the Data Science Institute’s own approach to community-centered data science, Dylan Halpern, Full-Stack Software Engineer at DSI and Susan Paykin, Senior Associate Director of Community-Centered Data Science, presented \n",

      " Hour Project, to quantify the impacts of the palm oil industry on deforestation and hold responsible corporations to account. The DSI team developed scripts to clean, extract, and standardize information from public reports to estimate the area affected by individual mills. The team then packaged these findings into PalmWatch, a \n",
      "public web tool\n",
      " where users can not only examine past impact but also estimate future deforestation risk by mill, company, brand, and country. The DSI has since continued its collaboration with IDI and PalmWatch through work with the Data Science Clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concluding poster session and reception showcased student-led work in community-centered data science research and applications. Students didn’t shy away from challenges, mapping access to public libraries with an eye to greater equity, and developing natural language models to enable more efficient and ethical institutional purchasing practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another student team trained LLMs to identify problematic loans for BankTrack, an organization that tracks the activity of private banks. One of these students, Jack Sanderson (BS ’27), was inspired to continue exploring the space. He has since focused on AI safety and security and expressed excitement after the event to continue applying frontier technologies to real-world problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Path Ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "Community-centered data science is core to the DSI’s mission of research, holistic education, and cross-disciplinary partnerships. Since 2021, the DSI has served as the \n",
      "centralized hub for data science and software\n",
      " for the 11th Hour Project, a program of the Schmidt Family Foundation, which supports nonprofits across its programs in energy, food and agriculture, human rights, indigenous communities, and marine technology. Through this partnership, the DSI hosts its Data Science Clinic, which provides direct support to social impact organizations while offering opportunities to inspire the next generation of public interest data scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DSI also aims to broaden participation in technical and data science fields. Programming such as the Data Science for Social Impact (DSSI) Summer Experience and Data4All provide rigorous yet supportive research environments for undergraduate and high school students to engage with real-world data science problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Tech-for-Good Careers attracted a diversity of students, with not only data scientists but aspiring data journalists at UChicago and Chicagoland high school students in attendance. As Dhar said in conversation with Professor Nicolae, “In many ways, the students in this room are the ones who are going to architect this space.” If the evening’s engagement was any indication, UChicago students are up to the challenge.\n",
